## Pain in the BAC(net)

BACnet Stands for Building Automation and Control Networks. BACnet was formed by ASHRAE in 1995 as Standard 135.

### Challenge

Attached is a packet capture taken from a building management network. One of the analog sensors reported values way outside of its normal operating range. Can you determine the object name of this analog sensor? 

Flag Format: flag{Name-of-sensor}. 
For example if the object name of this analog sensor was "Sensor_Temp1", the flag would be flag{Sensor_Temp1}. (Note: because there are a limited number of sensors, we're only giving you two guesses for this challenge, so please check your input carefully.)

### present-value

![wireshark capture showing the present-value listed below](wireshark_bacapp-present-value.png)

The present-value contains the real values of sensor readings.  Sensors should report readings within an acceptable range.  In the query below, instance number 7 has some sensor readings between 1400 - 1500, but a few readings are slightly above 99999.  The sensor name for the sensor reporting these high readings is most likely the flag.

```
$ tshark -T fields -e bacapp.present_value.real -e bacapp.instance_number -r bacnet.pcap 'bacapp.objectType==analog-input && bacapp.property_identifier==present-value && bacapp.present_value.real && bacapp.instance_number==7' | sort -n

```
The following queries show some helpful commands.  Sorting tshark output can be useful.  
sort -n sorts the output by the first field or ``` bacapp.present_value.real ``` in this query.  sort -nr sorts in reverse order.
```
tshark -T fields -e bacapp.present_value.real -e bacapp.instance_number -r bacnet.pcap 'bacapp.objectType==analog-input && bacapp.property_identifier==present-value && bacapp.present_value.real' | sort -n

tshark -T fields -e bacapp.present_value.real -e bacapp.instance_number -r bacnet.pcap 'bacapp.objectType==analog-input && bacapp.property_identifier==present-value && bacapp.present_value.real' | sort -nr
```
This query reveals the present-value in all the analog-input object types:
```
tshark -T fields -e bacapp.present_value.real -r bacnet.pcap 'bacapp.objectType==analog-input && bacapp.property_identifier==present-value && bacapp.present_value.real'
```
In order to get the name of the sensor reporting the high values slightly above 99999, get the object_name.

### object_name

tshark -T fields -e bacapp.instance_number -e frame.number -e bacapp.object_name -r bacnet.pcap 'bacapp.objectType==analog-input && bacapp.object_name && bacapp.instance_number==7'
